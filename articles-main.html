                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">  <br>  In these times of pandemic, the sufferings, death, agony, insecurity, helplessness…..the whole world is running hither and thither to save their lives and the lives of their loved ones. The entire human race has been disappointed when even the governing authorities of their countries and even more the world’s supreme organisations also have failed to save the lives of the people from this terror of death caused by CORONA. None of the man’s riches,or qualifications nor high status is able to stop this DEATH. DEATH IS THE ONLY ISSUE WIHICH MAKES EVEN THE  STRONGEST MAN OF THE WORLD TO TREMBLE WITH FEAR.<br><br>
                              But a true Christian never fears this DEATH, though this physical sickness and the physical death seems to be very painful and unbearable to him as it is to all mankind, because he has great hope, faith, joy and peace in the LIFE that is promised to him in Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. He believes the word of God. As the Bible says ;<br><br>
                  HE HAS CROSSED OVER FROM DEATH TO LIFE:. Jesus said in  John 5:24 “I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, he has crossed over from death to life.”<br><br>
                  I GIVE ETERNAL LIFE TO THEM, AND THEY SHALL NOT PERISH:. Jesus said in John 10:27 “ My sheep listen to my voice, I know them, and they  follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, no one can snatch them from my hand.” A christian is called the sheep of Jesus, though he dies physically he will not perish.( every human being dies physically but only the sinners perish.)<br><br>
                  I WILL RAISE THEM UP ON THE LAST DAY: In John 6:39 God speaks regarding His will concerning His children, “And this is the will of Him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that He has given me, but raise them up at the last day.”This is the great HOPE of LIFE that every true Christian has  in Jesus Christ.<br><br>
                  HE HAS GIVEN US NEW BIRTH AND RESERVED AN INHERITANCE IN HEAVEN: Peter says in 1Peter 1:3-4 “ In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade – kept in heaven for you, who through faith are Sheilded/reserved by God’s power until the coming of the salvation  that is ready to be revealed in the last time.” What a great assurance a Christian has, as God has already done this for him.<br><br>
                  YOU WERE SEALED FOR THE DAY OF REDEMPTION: Paul the Apostle encourages every Christian in Ephesians 4:30 “And, do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of Redemption.” Every true Christian of God is already sealed. This very seal divides the world into two groups – the sealed and the unsealed. And only in this seal is the safety, security and life.<br><br>
                                  Therefore, STEPHEN the first martyr for the Gospel dared to die a cruel death, as we all know, he was stoned to death. Then followed all the apostles except apostle John, almost all faced cruel deaths many were beheaded and few others hanged upside down. From  the first century we can see Christians were thrown to the hungry lions, burned alive, chopped into pieces, thrown into heated oil, thrown into dark dungeons to death.  They dared to die such deaths but never gave up their faith in Jesus Christ our saviour. God is building His kingdom with such people of power.<br><br>
                                   Paul says in Ephesians 4: 31 “ Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ, God forgave you.” In Hebrew 7:25 God says “ Therefore He is able to save completely those who come to God through Him(Jesus) because He always lives to intercede for them.” <br><br>
                                    God who led Israel, is enthroned in the heavenlies is also leading us today. Let us hear His word, let us not be only hearers but also doers and believe that we are secure in Him whom we believe. Amen.<br><br>
